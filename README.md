# NCAAF game data in Home Assistant

This integration fetches data for a NCAAF team's current/future game, and creates a sensor with attributes for the details of the game. 

The integration is a shameless fork of the excellent [HA NFL](https://github.com/zacs/ha-nfl) custom component by @zacs which was a fork from the [NWS alerts](https://github.com/finity69x2/nws_alerts) custom component by @finity69x2. Thank you both for the starting place!

## Sensor Data

### State
The sensor is pretty simple: the main state is `PRE`, `IN`, `POST`, `BYE` or `NOT_FOUND`, but there are attributes for pretty much all aspects of the game, when available. State definitions are as you'd expect:
- `PRE`: The game is in pre-game state. This happens on the first day of the game week, which seems to be Tuesday evenings around midnight Eastern time (once all the games through the Monday Night Football game are wrapped up). 
- `IN`: The game is in progress.
- `POST`: The game has completed. 
- `BYE`: Your given team has a bye week this week. Note that attributes available are limited in this case (only abreviation, name, logo, and last updated time will be available). 
- `NOT_FOUND`: There is no game found for your team, nor is there a bye. This should only happen at the end of the season, and once your team is eliminated from postseason play. 

### Attributes
The attributes available will change based on the sensor's state, a small number are always available (team abbreviation, team name, and logo), but otherwise the attributes only populate when in the current state. The table below lists which attributes are available in which states.

## Installation

### Manually

Clone or download this repository and copy the "nfl" directory to your "custom_components" directory in your config directory

```<config directory>/custom_components/nfl/...```
  
### HACS

1. Open the HACS section of Home Assistant.
2. Click the "..." button in the top right corner and select "Custom Repositories."
3. In the window that opens paste this Github URL.
4. In the window that opens when you select it click om "Install This Repository in HACS"
  
## Configuration

You'll need to know your team ID, which is a 2- or 3-letter acronym (eg. "SEA" for Seattle or "NE" for New England). You can find yours at https://espn.com/nfl in the top scores UI. 

### Via the "Configuration->Integrations" section of the Home Assistant UI

Look for the integration labeled "NFL" and enter your team's acronym in the UI prompt. You can also enter a friendly name. If you keep the default, your sensor will be `sensor.nfl`, otherwise it will be `sensor.friendly_name_you_picked`. 

### Manually in your `configuration.yaml` file

To create a sensor instance add the following configuration to your sensor definitions using the team_id found above:

```
- platform: nfl
  team_id: 'SEA'
```

After you restart Home Assistant then you should have a new sensor called `sensor.nfl` in your system.

You can overide the sensor default name (`sensor.nfl`) to one of your choosing by setting the `name` option:

```
- platform: nfl
  team_id: 'SEA'
  name: Seahawks
```

Using the configuration example above the sensor will then be called "sensor.seahawks".
